# July-LeetCoding-Challenge
Java Solutions with descriptive comments and multiple approaches, from failed attempts to brute force to optimal ones. 
When I have been unable to solve a problem I have learnt and implemented the solution myself so, this repository is free of copied code!

Open to suggestions/newer approaches, send a PR!
